# Hand Movement Recognition

Quick MediaPipe experiment I built to test out computer vision and hand tracking. Made this for fun to see what you can do with gesture recognition.

## What it does
- Tracks hand movements in real-time using MediaPipe
- Creates visual effects based on different hand gestures:
  - Peace sign = stars
  - Fist = explosion effect
  - Open hand = electric sparks
- Pinch to scale the main circle
- Two hands = electric arc between them

## Tech
Python • MediaPipe • OpenCV

## Run it
```bash
python hand_dots.py
```
